# Tensorflow implementation of bead_anomaly detection.

## Working Steps
- git clone from here to your work place.
- Download the video from here: [videolink](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dMlBZAX8ySozk4UzoS0yKyZi94LOLK2F/view?usp=sharing) and keep it in the same directory.
- run <b><t>main.ipynb</b></t> which has the CNN implemetation mentioned in <b><t>trial_cnn.py</b></t>.
- <b><t>trial.py</b></t> contains the LSTM implementation of similar dataset.
